- *A clock app that changes the hour and/or the minute once the screen or buttons are clicked, shows the hour and minutes and determines wether it is AM or PM*

### **[Clock](https://github.com/badebasligil/badebasligil/blob/main/Project/Clock%20v3.swiftpm.zip)**

- *A clock app that changes the hour and/or the minute once the screen or buttons are clicked, shows the hour and minutes and determines wether it is AM or PM, the clock is also shaped like a bear and the pose of the bear changes according to the hours of the day*

- *[The Codes](https://github.com/badebasligil/badebasligil/blob/main/Project/Swift_Playground/clock_v3_codes)*

- *Target Audience: ages 2-8*

  * Why?: because there are many different designs out there for kids at that age but none actually represent the mood of the hours in a friendly way.

- *How do your design choices support this audience?: for instance, once the clock hits 8 PM the bear starts to sleep representing 'sleep time' for the kids, during the morning it wakes up, etc.*

- *How did research (FigJam) influence your design?: me and my partner didn't know what kind of design to do on the clock to make it more appealing to kids, the research (Figjam) helped us decide on that.*

- *What was the most challenging part of coding?: coding the costume changes depending on the time was the hardest part*
  
- *How did ForEach make your code simpler? it helped me avoid writing the same code over and over*

- *What did you learn about randomness in programming? i learned that random in programming isn’t really random but it's generated by the computer*

- *Which part was most challenging: design, logic, or input/output? the logic part was the most challenging*

- *How is this project similar to Scratch’s “repeat” and “pick random” blocks? ForEach is like the repeat block, Random functions in code are like pick random block*
