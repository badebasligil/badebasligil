### **[Clock](https://github.com/badebasligil/badebasligil/blob/main/Project/Clock%20v3.swiftpm.zip)**

- *A clock app that changes the hour and/or the minute once the screen or buttons are clicked, shows the hour and minutes and determines wether it is AM or PM, the clock is also shaped like a bear and the pose of the bear changes according to the hours of the day*

- *Target Audience: ages 2-8*

  **Why?:** because there are many different designs out there for kids at that age but none actually represent the mood of the hours in a friendly way.

- **How do your design choices support this audience?:** for instance, once the clock hits 8 PM the bear starts to sleep representing 'sleep time' for the kids, during the morning it wakes up, etc.

- **How did research (FigJam) influence your design?:** me and my partner didn't know what kind of design to do on the clock to make it more appealing to kids, the research (Figjam) helped us decide on that.

- **What was the most challenging part of coding?:** coding the costume changes depending on the time was the hardest part
  
- **How did ForEach make your code simpler?** it helped me avoid writing the same code over and over

- **What did you learn about randomness in programming?** i learned that random in programming isn’t really random but it's generated by the computer

- **Which part was most challenging: design, logic, or input/output?** the logic part was the most challenging

- **How is this project similar to Scratch’s “repeat” and “pick random” blocks?** ForEach is like the repeat block, Random functions in code are like pick random block

  ### **[Ice Cream Overflow](Project/Swift_Playground/amınoğlumaraş.swiftpm.zip)**

- *An Ice Cream app that teaches binary and decimal numbers through scoops and overflows*

- *[The Codes]([Project/Swift_Playground/IceCrem_Codes](https://github.com/badebasligil/badebasligil/blob/main/Project/Swift_Playground/IceCrem_Codes))*

- **What is overflow in your app?** It happens when the number goes past 15 and can’t fit in 4 bits
  
- **How does the cone show abstraction?** The cone is a simple shape that represents a real ice cream cone
  
- **What did you learn about binary & compression?** I learned that computers use 1s and 0s to store data and make it simpler
