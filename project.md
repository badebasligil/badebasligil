### **[Clock-Version 3](https://github.com/badebasligil/badebasligil/blob/main/Project/Clock%20v3.swiftpm.zip)**

- *A clock app that changes the hour and/or the minute once the screen or buttons are clicked, shows the hour and minutes and determines wether it is AM or PM, the clock is also shaped like a bear and the pose of the bear changes according to the hours of the day*

- *Target Audience: ages 2-8*

- * Why?: because there are many different designs out there for kids at that age but none actually represent the mood of the hours in a friendly way. *

- *How do your design choices support this audience?: for instance, once the clock hits 8 PM the bear starts to sleep representing 'sleep time' for the kids, during the morning it wakes up, etc.*

- *How did research (FigJam) influence your design?: me and my partner didn't know what kind of design to do on the clock to make it more appealing to kids, the research (Figjam) helped us decide on that.*

- *What was the most challenging part of coding?: coding the costume changes depending on the time was the hardest part*
